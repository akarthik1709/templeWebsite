# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## This gives a comprehensive overview of all the tools and technologies used as part of the stack implementation

### Tools and Technologies
- Vite.js
- React FE
- Express Server
- Tailwind CSS

### Concepts and implementation done
- Used Carousal concept with the images declared in an array
- Iterated through the images with translateX(-100/+100). This moves the images perpetually from the left-right/right-left along the carousal track
- Added Payment Gateway integrated with Stripe and added the GPay option. 


### TBD:
- Need to add UPI with a QR code input
- User login (Will requirea database either mongodb or postgresql)
- Misc..
